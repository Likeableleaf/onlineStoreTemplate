# Project 1: Software Requirements Specification Document

This serves as a template for each projects' Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. When filling this out, you will be required to create user stories, use cases, requirements, and a glossary of terms relevant to your project. Each group member must contribute to every section, so it is crucial that your group's GitHub repository shows a commit history that reflects the work of each group member. It is highly recommended that you create separate branches for each member, but since this is one single document, you will need to manually merge the branches together. It is also advisable to have multiple working versions of this document (named separately) so that one person can compile the final SRS document from the multiple working versions. Ultimately, how you go about managing this is up to you, but consistent formatting, clear commit messages, and a thorough commit history with contributions from each group member are required.

Fill the document out following the guidelines listed in each section. Maintain [proper Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Introduction

<!-- In this section, you should give a brief overview of what your project will be. Describe the software system you are building and what problems it solves. You should also give a short description of the stakeholders (users of the system) and what their needs are. There is no set formatting requirement, but you should maintain a consistent structure across future sections. Not all members must contribute to this section. -->

For this project we will be creating a website for a coffee shop. This will provide the coffee shop with an online presence and accept orders and payments through the site. The system we are building will provide users with images, descriptions, prices, and customizations of coffee drinks. The system will also also users to add and remove items from their cart, to check out, and to pay for their orders. 

## Requirements

Each group member must supply at least three functional requirements for the project. Each requirement should be written in the following format:

- **ID:** A unique identifier for the requirement. This should be a number that is unique across the entire document (something like REQ-1, REQ-2, etc. but be sure to replace the word `ID` with the unique identifier).
  - **Description:** A short description of the requirement. This should be a single sentence that describes the requirement. Do not replace the word `Description` with the actual description. Put the description in the space where these instructions are written. Maintain that practice for all future sections.
  - **Type:** The type of requirement. Should be either `Functional` or `Non-Functional`.
  - **Priority:** The priority of the requirement. This should be a number between 1 and 5, with 1 being the highest priority and 5 being the lowest priority.

## Constraints

<!-- In this section, you should list any constraints that you have for the project. Each group member must supply at least two constraints. These can be constraints on the project itself, the software system, or the stakeholders. Constraints can be anything that limits the scope of the project. For example, that this project's template code is written using Flask and Python constitutes a constraint on the backend of the project. Constraints can also be things like the required timeline of the project. Be creative. -->

**Timeline:** The required timeline for the project requires a certain level of haste and determination, ensuring correct parts are done by the correct time. Looming deadlines increases stress for the project.

**Working as a Team:** Working as a team can be constraining because each team member has their own schedule, lives, and responsibilities outside of this project. Finding a good time to work together or even talk together at the same time in the group chat can be difficult. 



## Use Cases

In this section, you should list use cases for the project. Use cases are a thorough description of how the system will be used. Each group member must supply at least two use cases. Each use case should be written in the following format:

- **ID:** A unique identifier for the use case. This should be a number that is unique across the entire document (something like UC-1, UC-2, etc. but be sure to replace the word `ID` with the unique identifier).
  - **Description:** A description of the use case that gives the user a high-level overview of how the system is interacted with.
  - **Actors:** A list of the actors that are involved in the use case. Only include the actors that are directly involved. Actors are the people or things that interact with the system. For example, when ordering at a fast food restaurant, one might have the following actors: the customer, the cashier, and the cook. But only the customer and the cashier are directly involved in the use case of ordering food. The cook is not directly involved in the use case of ordering food.
  - **Preconditions:** A list of the preconditions for the use case. This should be a list of the preconditions for the use case, which are the conditions that must be met before the use case can be executed. Continuing with the restaurant example, the customer must have money in their wallet and the cashier must be logged in to the system before the use case of ordering food can be executed.
  - **Postconditions:** A list of the postconditions for the use case. This should be a list of the postconditions for the use case, which are the conditions that must be met after the use case has been executed. Continuing with the restaurant example, the customer must have their food and the cashier must have the customer's money after the use case of ordering food has been executed.
- **UC-1:** 
  - **Description:** A customer visits the coffee shop website. 
  - **Actors:** The Customer
  - **Preconditions:** The customer must have internet connection and the coffee shop's server needs to be online.
  - **Postconditions:** The customer must have seen the coffee drinks provided. 
- **UC-2:** 
  - **Description:** A customer adds coffee drinks to their cart. 
  - **Actors:** The Customer
  - **Preconditions:** The customer must be on the coffee shop's website and have browsed the drink options.
  - **Postconditions:** The cart will have updated to hold the customer's drink order and total. The customer must have seen their total. 

## User Stories

In this section, you should list user stories for the project. User stories are a short description of how a user will be interacting with the system. Each group member must supply at least two user stories. Each user story should be written in the following format:

- **ID:** A unique identifier for the user story. This should be a number that is unique across the entire document (something like US-1, US-2, etc. but be sure to replace the word `ID` with the unique identifier).
  - **Type of User:** The type of user that the user story is for. This should be a single word that describes the type of user. For example, a user story for a customer might be `Customer` and a user story for an administrator might be `Admin`.
  - **Description:** A description of the user story that gives a narrative from that user's perspective. This can be any length, but it must paint the picture of what the user wants to do, how they intend to do it, why they want to, and what they expect to happen.
- **US-1:** 
  - **Type of User:** `Customer`
  - **Description:**  As a customer, I want to visit the coffee shop's website and browse the drinks that they are offering. I am interested in learning more about the coffee shop's drink offerings. I expect their website to load, and display all of the different options, with their descriptions and prices shown as well.
- **US-2:** 
  - **Type of User:** `Customer`
  - **Description:**  As a customer, I want order coffee drinks from the coffee shop website, because I am thirsty. I am expecting to be able to customize my order and add it to the cart. The cart function should update to show my customized drink order and show me the option to continue to check out.
## Glossary

In this section, you should list any terms that are used in the document that may not be immediately obvious to a naive reader. Each group member must supply at least one term. Each term should be written in the following format:

- **Term:** The term that is being defined. This should be a single word or phrase that is being defined.
  - **Definition:** A definition of the term. This should be a short description of the term that is being defined. This should be a single sentence that describes the term.
- **Actor:** 
  - **Definition:** Actors are the people or things that interact with the system

Try to only list terms that a naive user would not understand.
